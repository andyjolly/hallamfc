# Hallam FC Fixtures Calendar

This repository contains tools to generate ICS (iCalendar) files with Hallam FC football fixtures.
The calendar can be imported into most calendar applications and will automatically update when fixtures are modified.

## What is an ICS file?

An ICS (iCalendar) file is a standard format for sharing calendar events. It can be imported into most calendar applications including:

- Google Calendar
- Apple Calendar
- Microsoft Outlook
- Mozilla Thunderbird
- Most mobile calendar apps

## Workflow

This repository uses a JSON-based approach for better maintainability:

1. **Edit JSON files** - Add or modify fixtures in readable JSON format
2. **Run the generator script** - Use `python3 generate_ics.py <season>` to create the ICS file
3. **Import the ICS file** - Add the generated ICS file to your calendar application

## JSON File Format

Each season has its own JSON file (e.g., `2024-2025.json`) containing an array of fixtures:

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-08-04",
    "kick-off": "14:00",
    "competition": "League",
    "opponent": "Sheffield FC",
    "is_home": true,
    "last_updated": "2025-08-04T21:35:00Z",
    "version": 1
  },
  {
    "date": "2025-08-11",
    "kick-off": "15:00",
    "competition": "League",
    "opponent": "Worksop Town",
    "is_home": false,
    "away_ground": {
      "name": "Windsor Foodservice Stadium",
      "address": "Windsor Foodservice Stadium, Worksop"
    },
    "last_updated": "2025-08-04T21:35:00Z",
    "version": 1
  }
]
```

### Fixture Fields

- **date**: Match date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **kick-off**: Kick-off time in HH:MM format (24-hour)
- **competition**: Competition type (e.g., "League", "Cup")
- **opponent**: The opposing team name

## Generating ICS Files

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Usage

```bash
# Generate ICS file from JSON data
python3 generate_ics.py 2024-2025

# The script will automatically:
# - Find the JSON file (json/2024-2025.json)
# - Extract season from filename (2024-2025.json â†’ 2024/25)
# - Generate output file in ics/ directory (ics/2024-2025.ics)
# - Create unique UIDs for each fixture
# - Format descriptions with social media links
```

### Example

```bash
# Generate the fixtures calendar
python3 generate_ics.py 2024-2025
# Output: Successfully generated 'ics/2024-2025.ics' with 3 fixtures

# If file not found, shows available options
python3 generate_ics.py 2025-2026
# Output: Available JSON files: ['2024-2025.json']
# Error: Could not find JSON file for season '2025-2026'
```

## Calendar Features
